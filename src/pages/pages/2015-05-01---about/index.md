Hi! Thanks for stopping by my blog. My name is Nelson Guti√©rrez. I am a self-taught front end developer based in Costa Rica. In my journey, I have learned tons reading coding blogs (and continue to do so), which is why I decided to start this blog in order to write down important milestones or concepts I have recently grasped.

*This is a picture with my beautiful family hiking in the Costa Rican mountains.*

I create cool websites and web applications. I'm currently seeking to join a software team where I can contribute to accomplish the teams's goals as well as grow personally as a developer.

You can contact me at : nelson.gutierrez.vega@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
